# Cellphone_Robot

Welcome to the Cellphone_Robot project! Through this project we are aiming to expand on Android based robotics. myRobot, the app within this repository, was created to control a small ROS controlled car-robot. 

This project is still in early development, further updates and robots will be coming soon. In the meantime please feel free to delve into our extensive [wiki](https://github.com/AGKhalil/Cellphone_Robot/wiki) or the first [research paper](https://github.com/AGKhalil/Cellphone_Robot/blob/master/Cell%20Phone%20Robot%20Paper.pdf) written surrounding this project and Lily, our first robot.

Here's a picture of Lily!
