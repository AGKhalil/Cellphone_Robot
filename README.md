# Cellphone_Robot

Welcome to the Cellphone_Robot project! Through this project we are aiming to expand on cell phone based robotics. myRobot, the app within this repository, was created to control a small car-robot. When the app is open on the phone on top of the robot, anyone can send the robot an SMS of a location. That could be a street, building, etc. Then the robot will use GPS data to navigate to said destination. 

This project is still in early development, further updates and robots will be coming soon. In the meantime please feel free to delve into our extensive [wiki](https://github.com/AGKhalil/Cellphone_Robot/wiki) or the first [research paper](https://github.com/AGKhalil/Cellphone_Robot/blob/master/Cell%20Phone%20Robot%20Paper.pdf) written surrounding this project and Lily, our first robot.
